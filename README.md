### Hi there 👋😃

I'm Emixi, a PhD candidate in *water engineering* at Laval University. My research interests include a deep understanding of **hydrological processes** at the catchment scale and the **predictability**, **forecasting** and **impacts** of **natural hazards**. I have experience in **hydrological modeling**, **hydro-meteorological forecasting**, and **post-processing** techniques at short- to medium-time scales.

I started coding while doing my master's degree and I can say my interest in this field has only grown with time. I’m currently sharpening my **data analysis skill** set 👩🏽‍💻 📈. In my spare time you will probably find me doing sports (🧗‍♀️,🧘‍♀️,🚴‍♂️,🏃🏽‍♀️), cooking vegan meals 🍲 🍛 🍞, or building fun (and partially useless) software programs.

Au plaisir 😊 !
