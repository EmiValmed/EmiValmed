### Hi there! 👋

My name is Emixi, I am a hydrologist currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer. I am passionate about photography and data-driven technologies. In my spare time you will probably find me doing sports,  or building fun (and partially useless) software programs.

I was born in Do, and I work and live in Ca.
